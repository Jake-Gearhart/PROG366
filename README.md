### Assignment1
Simple methods with differing time complexity: Constant, Linear, and Exponential.

### Bag
Implements a "Bag" data structure that contains integers. The integers are stored as a linked list, and can only be accessed randomly by the bag's iterator.

### Blackjack
Implements the game of blackjack, and includes the utilization of the Fischer-Yates shuffling algorithm.

### CandyCrush
A console-app version of the game Candy Crush. It features algorithms to populate the game board, allow pieces to fall into empty spaces, clear lines created by three or more similar elements in a row, and to clear all similar elements regardless of where they are.

### Connect4
A console-app version of the game Connect Four, featuring algorithms to drop pieces into open spaces, and to detect winners when four or more of the same player's pieces are in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### DataStructures
Implements four different ways of storing and accessing sample data: List, Dictionary, Stack, Queue

### ExponentMethod
An analysis of the time and space complexity of an exponential function.

### MatryoshkaDolls
Algorithms to perform actions on Matryoshka Dolls, and analyses of their complexity.

### Maze
A console-app maze game with a moveable character, collision detection, and winning detection.

### MergeSortedLists
An algorithm to merge sorted linked lists.

### TwoSum
An algorithm to find which two elements in an array add up to a target sum.

### Sorting
Implementations of the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, HeapSort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort algorithms.
